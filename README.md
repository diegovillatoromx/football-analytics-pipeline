# Kick Off: Automating Football Data Ingestion into Snowflake with Airflow

The football-data-ingestion project is a data ingestion system designed to gather football league information from various sources and load it into a Snowflake database using Apache Airflow. This automated pipeline enables real-time or scheduled extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of football data, providing a platform for in-depth football statistics analysis and reporting. The repository contains scripts, Airflow operators, and configurations necessary to set up and run the football data ingestion pipeline efficiently and reliably.
